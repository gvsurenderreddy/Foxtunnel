Short guide to installing proxytunnel

On most modern unix systems, use the normal Makefile, possibly uncommenting
the section related to your system (darwin/cygwin/solaris/openbsd)

If you want to enable setproctitle functionality, add a CFLAGS define
-DSETPROCTITLE (uncomment sample in Makefile)

Run make and optionally 'make install'.
If you manually want to install, copy proxytunnel to /usr/local/bin
and optionally the manual-page from the debian-subdirectory to your manpath

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cygwin:

To run, copy the required dll's from the cygwin-bin dir to the proxytunnel directory (cygcrypto-1.0.1.dll,
cygssl-1.0.1.dll, cygwin1.dll)

Setproctitle doesn't work on cygwin! (afaik)
